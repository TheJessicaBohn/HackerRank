Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix  is shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  

The left-to-right diagonal = 1 + 5 + 9 = 15. The right to left diagonal =  3 + 5 + 9 = 17. Their absolute difference is |15 - 17| = 2.

Function description

Complete the diagonalDifference function in the editor below.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

int arr[n][m]: an array of integers

Return

int: the absolute diagonal difference

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, n, the number of rows and columns in the square matrix arr.
Each of the next n lines describes a row, arr[i], and consists of n space-separated integers arr[i][j] .

Constraints
-100<= arr[i][j] <= 100

Output Format

Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

Obs: lembrando de i = x, j = y então arr[3][3], array tem tamnho 3, porém posição vai de [0],[1],[2];
